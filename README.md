# What is IndiTranslate?
Inditranslate.com was created after my work in a hospice home during the pandemic. It is a tool that allows staff to communicate with single-language Indigenous elders. 

# What is this repo for?
This repository is meant to lower the barrier of entry for building solutions to indigenous language problems.

# Is this legit?
This project is supported by Future Design School through the Audrey Wearn Language Prize.
