# What is IndiTranslate?
[IndiTranslate](https://www.inditranslate.com) was created after my work in a hospice home during the pandemic. It is a tool that allows staff to communicate with single-language Indigenous elders. The translations are focused on procedural norms in these homes. 

# What is this repo for?
This repository is meant to lower the barrier of entry for building solutions to Indigenous language problems.

# Funding?
This project is supported by Future Design School through the Audrey Wearn Language Prize. We are not currently accepting donations.
